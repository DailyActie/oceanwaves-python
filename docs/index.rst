Welcome to oceanwaves's documentation!
======================================

Oceanwaves is a Python package that provides a generic data storage
object for ocean wave data (time series and/or spectral). The package
provides a series of I/O functions to use with various file formats,
like `SWAN <http://swanmodel.sourceforge.net>`_, `Waverider buoys
<http://datawell.nl>`_ and `WaveDroid <http://www.wavedroid.net>`_.

Oceanwaves is a merger of the functionalities of the `pyswan
<https://github.com/openearth/pyswan>`_ toolbox, originally developed
by Gerben de Boer, and the `swantools
<https://pypi.python.org/pypi/swantools/>`_ toolbox, originally
developed by Caio Eadi Stringari.

The source code of the oceanwaves package can be found at
`<https://github.com/openearth/oceanwaves-python>`_.
